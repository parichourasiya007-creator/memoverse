Update the MemoVerse prototype by adding a **Login-Free Multi-Profile System with Personalized Data Storage**.

IMPORTANT:
Do NOT create a traditional login, password, email verification, or OTP system.

MemoVerse should allow elderly users to create a simple personal profile without authentication.

The goal is:
**Create Profile → Use MemoVerse → Data is saved to that profile → Reopen later → Select the same profile → Continue where they left off.**

## 1. PROFILE SELECTION SCREEN

Create a screen titled:

**Who is using MemoVerse?**

Subtitle:

**Choose your profile to continue.**

Show large profile cards.

Example:

👵 **Kamla Devi**
Assamese • 12 activities completed

👴 **Ramesh Das**
Hindi • 8 activities completed

Add a large card:

➕ **Create New Profile**

Keep the interface extremely simple and elderly-friendly.

No username/password fields.

---

## 2. CREATE PROFILE SCREEN

Heading:

**Create Your Profile**

Subtitle:

**Just a few details to make MemoVerse personal for you.**

Ask only basic information:

### Your Name

Large text field:
**Enter your name**

### Age

Large simple selector:
**Age**

### Preferred Language

Large language cards:

* Assamese
* Manipuri
* Khasi
* Garo
* Mizo
* Bodo
* Nepali
* English

### Region

Simple selector:

**Select your region**

### Profile Photo

Optional:

**Add Photo**

Make it clearly optional.

### Accessibility Preferences

Show simple toggles:

🔊 **Spoken Guidance**

🔤 **Large Text**

📳 **Haptic Feedback**

At the bottom:

Large primary button:

**Create Profile**

Small text:

**Your information stays connected to your MemoVerse profile.**

---

## 3. PROFILE CREATED SUCCESS SCREEN

After profile creation, show:

**Your MemoVerse profile is ready!**

Example:

👵 Kamla Devi

**Language:** Assamese
**Region:** Assam

Show:

✓ Activities
✓ Memories
✓ Reminders
✓ Progress

Primary button:

**Go to Home**

---

# 4. PERSONALIZED HOME SCREEN

After selecting a profile, the home screen should clearly show the active user.

Top:

**Good Morning, Kamla 👋**

Small profile indicator:

👵 Kamla Devi

Add:

**Switch Profile**

The home page should have only three major actions:

### 🧠 Explore Activities

Practice memory and cognitive skills.

### 💭 My Memories

View your personal memories.

### 🔔 Reminders

See today's reminders.

Also show a featured activity:

**Recommended for You**

🎧 **Sounds of Home**

**A personalized activity based on your recent progress.**

Button:

**Start Activity**

---

# 5. PROFILE DATA / PERSONALIZATION

Design the prototype so that every profile has separate information.

For example:

### Kamla Devi

Activities:

* Completed: 12
* Best category: Listening
* Current level: 3

Memories:

* 5 saved memories

Reminders:

* 3 active reminders

Language:

* Assamese

Progress:

* Stored separately

---

### Ramesh Das

Activities:

* Completed: 8
* Best category: Memory
* Current level: 2

Memories:

* 3 saved memories

Reminders:

* 2 active reminders

Language:

* Hindi

The UI should visually communicate that **each profile has its own separate personalized data**.

---

# 6. SWITCH PROFILE

Create a simple profile-switching bottom sheet/modal.

Heading:

**Switch Profile**

Show:

👵 Kamla Devi
👴 Ramesh Das

And:

➕ **Create New Profile**

When another profile is selected, the Home, Memories, Progress, Activities and Reminders should visually change to that user's data.

---

# 7. MY MEMORIES — PROFILE SPECIFIC

Heading:

**My Memories**

Subtitle:

**Your personal memories, kept close.**

Show example memory cards:

📷 **Family Gathering**

🏡 **My Village**

🎵 **A Favorite Song**

👨‍👩‍👧 **Family**

Each memory belongs to the currently selected profile.

Add:

**+ Add Memory**

Memory creation can include:

* Photo
* Title
* Short description
* Voice note

Show:

🔊 **Listen to Memory**

Do not make this look like social media.

---

# 8. PROGRESS — PROFILE SPECIFIC

Heading:

**Your Progress**

Show simple statistics for the selected user.

Example:

**This Week**

🧠 Memory
8 activities

🎧 Listening
5 activities

🗣️ Words & Stories
4 activities

🏡 Everyday Memory
3 activities

Add an AI recommendation:

✨ **Personalized for Kamla**

“Based on your recent activities, try a listening activity today.”

Button:

**Try Recommended Activity**

Do NOT present medical diagnosis or claim to measure dementia severity.

Use wording such as:

**cognitive activity**, **memory support**, **personalized practice**, and **progress**.

---

# 9. REMINDERS — PROFILE SPECIFIC

Heading:

**Today's Reminders**

Show reminders belonging only to the selected profile.

Example:

🔔 **5:00 PM**
Take evening medicine

📞 **7:00 PM**
Call Ananya

Button:

**Add Reminder**

Optional voice input:

🎙️ **Speak a Reminder**

---

# 10. PERSISTENT DATA / OFFLINE-FIRST CONCEPT

Add a subtle status indicator throughout the app:

🟢 **Saved on this device**

When internet is unavailable:

**Offline Mode**

**Your profile, activities, memories and progress remain available offline.**

When internet returns:

☁️ **Syncing...**

Then:

✓ **All data is up to date**

For the prototype, visually communicate this as a product feature.

Do not require internet to start cognitive activities.

---

# 11. REOPEN APP FLOW

Create a realistic prototype flow demonstrating what happens when the user opens MemoVerse again later.

Flow:

**Open MemoVerse**

↓

**Who is using MemoVerse?**

↓

Select:

👵 Kamla Devi

↓

**Welcome back, Kamla 👋**

↓

Her previous:

* Progress
* Memories
* Reminders
* Activity history

are displayed.

Show a small message:

**Welcome back! Your progress is ready.**

This should make it clear that the user's data is persistent and profile-specific.

---

# 12. SETTINGS

Create a simple Settings screen.

### Profile

**Edit Profile**

**Switch Profile**

### Accessibility

🔊 Spoken Guidance
🔤 Large Text
📳 Haptic Feedback

### Appearance

☀️ Light Mode
🌙 Dark Mode

### Language

**Change Language**

### Data

Show:

**Stored on this device**

**Last synced: Today**

Do not add complicated account/security settings because MemoVerse is login-free.

# IMPORTANT PROTOTYPE BEHAVIOR

Make the Figma prototype clickable.

Demonstrate this complete journey:

**Welcome**

→ **Select/Create Profile**

→ **Create Profile**

→ **Grandparent Home**

→ **Activities**

→ **Play Activity**

→ **My Memories**

→ **Progress**

→ **Reminders**

→ **Switch Profile**

→ **Second Profile**

→ **Show different personalized data**

→ **Reopen App**

→ **Select Profile**

→ **Welcome Back with previous data**

The prototype should communicate that MemoVerse is:

**Login-free + Personalized + Multi-profile + Offline-first + Elderly-friendly + Region-aware.**

The final result should look like a polished SIH 2026 solution prototype, not a generic student dashboard.
